Certified Jenkins Engineer (CJE)
================================
1. Key CI/CD/Jenkins concepts: Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration Concepts
	Define continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment
		Countinues Delivery - means that code can be released at any time.
		Countinues Deployment - means code is released continuously as a  part of an automated pipeline.
		Continuous Integration â€“ practice of integrating the code continuously/every checkin.
	Stages of CI and CD
		Build(Checkout,Compile,Unit Test,Package), Deploy, and Test 
	What are jobs in Jenkins?
		Types of jobs - Freestyle, Maven, Pipeline, External Job, Multi Configuratio, Multi Job, Folder, MultiBranch Pipeline 
		Scope of jobs
	Builds
		What are builds in Jenkins?
			Result of a job(Can be scoped to any typical IT task, defined in Jenkins)
		What are build steps, triggers, artifacts, and repositories?
			Build steps- a single operation within a build
			triggers- something that starts a build (periodically{cron}, Poll SCM, Build after other projects are built,GitHub hook trigger , etc)
			artifacts- Output of a passed build(jar,zip,tar,...)
			repositories- SCM(Source Code Management)/VC(version Control): git,svn
		Build tools configuration
			Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration : here you can set build tool(mvn/ant/sbt/jdk) configuration	
	Source
		What are source code management systems and how are they used?
			SCM(Source Code Management)/VC(version Control): git,svn
			which are used to track your code changes.
		Cloud-based SCMs
			Github
			Bitbucket
			AWS Code Commit
		Jenkins changelogs
			Contains data about a change in a SCM
		Incremental updates v clean check out
			Incremental updates: Instead of deleting and re-cloning a project repository into a workspace,it just pulling any changes alone.
			clean check out: Clean the jobs workspace and re-cloning a project repository. 
		Checking in code
		Infrastructure-as-Code
			 infrastructure from manual tasks to code,
		Branch and Merge Strategies
			master- latest Stable code.
			Development- enables isolation and concurrent development.
			Feature- Feature isolation is a special derivation of the development isolation
			Release
	Testing
		Benefits of testing with Jenkins
			Testing every build result findout the defects/issues ASAP.
		Define unit test, smoke test, acceptance test, automated verification/functional tests
			unit test- It tests a small piece of functionality, usually at the class method level.
			smoke test-  aim at ensuring that the most important functions work.
			acceptance test- It tests against the product specifications.
			functional tests- It tests the functionality of the project as a whole .
	Notifications
		Types of notifications in Jenkins
			email
			slack
			hipchat
		Importance of notifications
			Result in fixing/identify the broken code faster.
	Distributed Builds
		What are distributed builds?
			Executing build on slave nodes.
			When you want to preserve resources on the master node you use distributed builds.
		Functions of masters and agents
			Master where you main jenkins server is running.
			Slave machine are used to execute jenkins jobs.
	Plugins
		What are plugins?
			Plugins can really be used to add any functionality to Jenkins.
		What is the plugin manager?
			plugin manager- help to manage jenkins plugin{install, uninstall, upgrade, downgrad or search plugins}
			Dashboard Left Panel -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins
	Jenkins Rest API
		How to interact with it
			Using:XML , JSON with JSONP support, Python
		What can you do with it?
			Retrieve information from Jenkins for programmatic consumption.
			Trigger a new build
			Create/copy jobs
		Why use it?
			you can get info programmatic way.
	Security
		Authentication versus authorization
			Authentication identifies a user.
			Authorization dictates what a user is allowed to do.
		Matrix security
			Jenkins permissions are defined in a matrix-like structure, in which the administrator can set security based on a user or user group.
			Major categories: overall, Credentials, Agent, Job, Run, View and SCM
		Definition of auditing, credentials, and other key security concepts
			auditing: Tracking who did what on your Jenkins server.
			credentials: to authenticate user.
	Fingerprints
		What are fingerprints?
			Fingerprints are an md5sum that is used to track artifacts.
		How do fingerprints work?
			Jenkins maintains a database of md5sum, and for each md5sum, Jenkins records which builds of which projects used. This database is updated every time a build runs and files are fingerprinted.
	Artifacts
		How to use artifacts in Jenkins
			ArchiveArtifacts can be used to set an archiving strategy for a project in a Jenkinsfile.
		Storing artifacts
			you can archive it and store in nexus.
	Using 3rd party tools
		How to use 3rd party tools
			you can install the repective plugin and configure it by Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration
		Installation Wizard
			What is the Jenkins Installation Wizard?
				You can install via repos/docker or running jenkins jar using java
		How to use the Wizard?
		Which configurations are covered by the Installation Wizard?
2.Jenkins usage
	Jobs
		Organizing jobs in Jenkins
			Projects can be organized in either Folders or Views.
		Parameterized jobs
			To pass values while running a project
		Usage of Freestyle/Pipeline/Matrix jobs
