Jenkins 1.535 and above is built with an internal web container called Jetty.

How to restart Jenkins manually?
To restart Jenkins via url, you can use either of the following commands:
(jenkins_url)/safeRestart - Allows all running jobs to complete. New jobs will remain in the queue to run after the restart is complete.
(jenkins_url)/restart - Forces a restart without waiting for builds to complete.
(jenkins_url)/reload - To reload the configuration.

Move jobs between 2 different Jenkins servers? 
Go to $JENKINS_HOME/jobs
Copy the files from Server1 to Server2 Job location and reload the server2.
